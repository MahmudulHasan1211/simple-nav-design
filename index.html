It uses Git software, providing the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.[6] Headquartered in California, it has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[7] GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.[17] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set salaries.[18]In 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, Tom Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[19]</p>
